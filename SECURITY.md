### Example Report Format

```
Subject: SECURITY VULNERABILITY - SQL Injection in User Authentication

Description:
A SQL injection vulnerability exists in the user authentication endpoint that allows 
attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Navigate to /api/auth/login
2. Send POST request with payload: {"email": "' OR 1=1--", "password": "anything"}
3. Observe successful authentication bypass

Impact:
This vulnerability allows complete authentication bypass, potentially giving 
attackers access to any user account.

Proof of Concept:
[Include screenshot or code snippet]

Suggested Fix:
Use parameterized queries for all database operations involving user input.

Contact: your-email@example.com
```

## Response Timeline

We aim to respond to security reports according to this timeline:

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Severity Assessment**: Within 48 hours  
- **Status Updates**: Every 72 hours until resolved
- **Resolution**: Based on severity (see below)

### Severity Levels and Response Times

| Severity | Description | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Critical** | Remote code execution, SQL injection, authentication bypass | 24-48 hours |
| **High** | Privilege escalation, sensitive data exposure | 3-7 days |
| **Medium** | Cross-site scripting (XSS), CSRF | 1-2 weeks |
| **Low** | Information disclosure, minor security issues | 2-4 weeks |

## Security Measures

### Current Security Implementations

- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js with secure session management
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Protection**: Encrypted sensitive data storage
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries with Prisma ORM
- **HTTPS Enforcement**: TLS encryption for all communications
- **Rate Limiting**: API endpoint protection against abuse
- **File Upload Security**: Secure file handling and validation
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin resource sharing setup
- **Environment Variables**: Secure configuration management

### Security Headers

The application implements the following security headers:

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; connect-src 'self'; font-src 'self' data:; object-src 'none'; media-src 'self'; frame-src 'none';
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
Permissions-Policy: geolocation=(), microphone=(), camera=()
```

## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs on both client and server side
   - Use proper TypeScript types and validation libraries
   - Sanitize data before database operations

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Never store passwords in plain text
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use role-based access control consistently
   - Validate user permissions for every protected action

3. **Database Security**
   - Use parameterized queries exclusively
   - Implement proper database connection security
   - Follow principle of least privilege for database access
   - Regular backup and recovery procedures

4. **API Security**
   - Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
   - Use proper HTTP status codes
   - Validate request headers and parameters
   - Implement proper error handling without information leakage

5. **File Upload Security**
   - Validate file types and sizes
   - Scan uploaded files for malware
   - Store files outside web root
   - Use secure file naming conventions

### Secure Coding Examples

#### Good: Parameterized Database Query
```typescript
const user = await prisma.user.findUnique({
  where: { 
    email: email,
    organizationId: organizationId 
  }
});
```

#### Bad: String Concatenation
```typescript
// NEVER DO THIS
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;
```

#### Good: Input Validation
```typescript
const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  name: z.string().min(2).max(100),
});

const validatedData = schema.parse(requestData);
```

#### Good: Authentication Check
```typescript
export async function GET(req: NextRequest) {
  const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
  if (!session || !session.user) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
  }
  
  // Proceed with authenticated logic
}
```
